## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### LLM Integration Pattern:
```python
class OllamaDeepSeekIntegration:
    def analyze_complex_problem(self, problem: str) -> dict:
        # Real API call to DeepSeek model
        response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload)
        return ai_analysis
        
    def recommend_team_structure(self, problem: str) -> dict:
        # AI-powered team recommendations
        return team_recommendations
        
    def generate_smart_goals(self, problem: str, team_type: str) -> list:
        # AI-generated SMART goals
        return smart_goals
```

### Framework Integration:
```python
# Create teams based on AI recommendations
team = team_designer.create_team(
    name=ai_recommendation["name"],
    discipline=ai_recommendation["discipline"],
    capabilities=ai_recommendation["key_roles"]
)

# Generate AI-powered goals
ai_goals = llm.generate_smart_goals(problem, team.discipline)
for goal_data in ai_goals:
    goal = team_designer.create_team_goal(**goal_data)
```
