    - Analytics and reporting dashboard
    """
    
    # AI analyzes problem and suggests teams

    print(f"Problem Complexity: {analysis['complexity_assessment']['score']}/10")
    print(f"Recommended Teams: {len(analysis['recommended_teams'])}")
    
    # Create teams based on AI recommendations
    created_teams = []
    for team_rec in analysis['recommended_teams']:
        team = team_designer.create_team(
            name=team_rec['name'],

        )
        created_teams.append(team)
        print(f"✅ Created: {team.name}")
    
    return created_teams

# Run the example
teams = asyncio.run(ai_team_creation())
```

### CLI Integration

```bash
# Create team using CLI
python -m feriq.cli.main team create "Data Science Team" data_science \
  --description "ML and analytics specialists" \

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Team Formation Strategy

```python
# Good: Specific capabilities and clear purpose
team = team_designer.create_team(
    name="Mobile Development Team",
    discipline="software_development",
    description="Specialized in cross-platform mobile app development",
    capabilities=["react_native", "flutter", "mobile_ui", "app_store_deployment"],
    team_type="autonomous"
)

# Better: AI-recommended team based on analysis
problem = "Build cross-platform mobile banking app with biometric security"
analysis = await ai.analyze_problem_and_suggest_teams(problem)
team = create_teams_from_ai_recommendations(analysis)
```

### 2. Goal Management

```python
# Good: SMART goal creation
goal = team_designer.create_team_goal(
    title="Implement User Authentication",
    description="Build secure user authentication with biometric support",
    priority="high",
    estimated_effort=40,
    success_criteria=["Biometric login working", "Security tests pass", "User testing completed"]
)

# Better: AI-generated SMART goals
smart_goals = await ai.generate_smart_goals(problem, team.discipline)
for goal_data in smart_goals:
    goal = team_designer.create_team_goal(**goal_data)
    team_designer.assign_goal_to_team(goal.id, team.id)
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

```python
# Continuous monitoring approach
def monitor_team_health():
    teams = team_designer.get_all_teams()
    
    for team in teams:
        metrics = team_designer.get_team_performance_metrics(team.id)
        
        # Alert on low performance
        if metrics['collaboration_score'] < 6.0:
            alert_team_collaboration_issue(team.id)
        
        # Suggest improvements
        if metrics['goal_completion_rate'] < 0.8:
            suggestions = team_designer.get_improvement_suggestions(team.id)
            implement_team_improvements(team.id, suggestions)

# Schedule regular monitoring
import schedule
schedule.every(1).hours.do(monitor_team_health)
```

### 4. Error Handling

```python
async def robust_team_creation():
    ai = DeepSeekIntegration(model="deepseek-coder:latest")
    team_designer = TeamDesigner()
    
    try:
        # Primary AI analysis
        analysis = await ai.analyze_problem_and_suggest_teams(problem)
        teams = create_teams_from_analysis(analysis)
        
    except ConnectionError:
        # Fallback to simpler model
        ai_fallback = DeepSeekIntegration(model="llama3.1:8b")
        analysis = await ai_fallback.analyze_problem_and_suggest_teams(problem)
        teams = create_teams_from_analysis(analysis)
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Manual team creation fallback
        logger.warning(f"AI analysis failed: {e}, creating default team")
        teams = [create_default_team(problem)]
    
    return teams
```
