  "team_recommendations": {
    "raw_ai_response": "Based on the problem analysis provided above, here is a suggested structure of how to implement this system with optimal components within an Agile development methodology (like Scrum or Kanban). \n\n1. **Team Size** - Each team should be responsible for detecting anomalies and integrating it into existing banking systems effectively while maintaining high speed & low delay in real time operations at acceptable levels of uptime, fault tolerance etc., which is a multi-faceted task requiring careful planning to ensure all components are optimized. \n2. **Team Types** - The team structure can be divided based on the expertise and roles within each component (Data Science/Machine Learning Team; Software Development & Research Teams). For example, Data Scientist would focus more upon data analysis while Machine Learning Engineer will handle model building for anomaly detection etc., \n3. **Key Roles** - Each team should have a dedicated role in implementing the system such as: Modeling and Building Anomalies Detection; Integrating with Existing Systems (Banking & Payment Processors); Providing Regulatory Compliance Decisions for AI decisions, Scalability of System across Data Centers etc.\n4. **Coordination Strategy** - The coordination strategy can be a team meeting or daily stand-up session where each member is present to discuss the progress and any issues they are facing in their roles within this system implementation. \n5. For handling complexities like concept drift, new fraud patterns etc., teams should work together closely as much possible while ensuring that all parts of it can communicate effectively through APIs or messaging queues for real-time data exchange purposes which will be a part of the overall team structure design and development process in Agile methodology.",
