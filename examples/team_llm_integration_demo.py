Team LLM Integration Demo - Feriq Framework

This demo shows how LLMs can be integrated with the Team Designer to enable:
- Intelligent plan design using LLM reasoning
- Autonomous task assignment based on AI analysis
- Inter-agent communication through natural language
- Collaborative workflows orchestrated by AI
- Goal extraction and refinement using language models

To run with actual LLM integration, configure your preferred model:
- Set OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenAI models
- Install and configure Ollama for local models
- Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude models
