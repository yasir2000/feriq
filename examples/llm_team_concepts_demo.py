LLM Team Integration Conceptual Demo - Feriq Framework

This demo illustrates how LLMs enhance team collaboration through:
- Intelligent plan design using AI reasoning
- Autonomous task assignment based on LLM analysis  
- Natural language inter-agent communication
- Collaborative workflow orchestration
- Goal extraction and refinement using language models

This is a conceptual demonstration showing the integration patterns.
